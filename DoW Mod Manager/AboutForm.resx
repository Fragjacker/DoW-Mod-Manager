    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Version 2.3.2.2

- Fixed unnecessary cast in method that searches for videodrivers. That may fix some rare issues with videocard detection
- Fixed a bug where Mod Manager would crash if you click on "Open folder..." button if you don't have any mods installed
- Sealed two classes for performance gain
- Changed StringBuilder + File.WriteAllText to a simple and more efficient StreamWriter
- Created new class - "extensions" and refactored GetValueFromLine() method to an extension
- Renamed a few variables here and there

## Version 2.3.1.0

- Changed the Open Folder button to open the referenced Mod folder of the module instead of the path based on filename of the module. It should always open a folder now if it exists.

## Version 2.3.0.0

- Added a Font Manager. Now you can add new fonts, and change fonts sizes for different UI elements!
- Some small code improvements

## Version 2.2.2.0

- Improved the Layout of the current active game directory label and textbox.
- Added a new button that allows to open the currently selected mod in a new windows explorer window, if it exists.

## Version 2.2.1.0

- Fixed a crash when there is no line 15 in spdx9_config.txt file in Drivers folder (thanks,  SergeantDiggs)
- WriteSettings() method in SettingManagerForm is more efficient now -allowhwcursor it uses StreamWriter instead of StringBuilder( + File.WriteAllLines())
    
## Version 2.2.0

- Added ability to download mods using MiniBrowser - an Internet Explorer 11 engine wrapped in a WebBrowser object in .NET Framework
- Fixed a bug where instead of a patch,  ModMownloaderForm would still download the mod itself
- Fixed a bug where you click on a non-existent item in RequiredMods Mods when you have no mods installed
- Version checking is more reliable now (version number could be &amp;gt; 9 now,  for example 2.1.10)
- State Machine is simplified now: "ngen install" will be performed every start if "AOTCompilation" setting is selected (it's much more simpler and reliable that way)
- ModManagerForm will write all Settings to a file more efficient when closing
- Renamed a few variables
    
## Version 2.1.9

- Fixed Mod Merger busting some Mods when attempting to merge, such as Unification.
- Fixed disabled Mods not to appear as missing mods in the required mods list, preventing the start of the game, eventhough they would be ignored by the game anyways.
- Removed W40k and DXP2 base game modules from eligible mergeable/starteable mods, since they should never be messed with anyways.
- Fixed the tooltip for the ''No Fog'' disable checkbox, that didn't appear when it was supposed to.
- Added new warning label to the Mod Merger to warn users of potential causes of crashes when used inappropriately.
- Added support for mods, that are not installed but declared as a deactivated mod in a .module file to be displayed and handled in the mod merger.
- Using a slightly brighter green tone for green text passages.
- Mod Merger inactive mods are now highlighted in an orange tone, missing mods are now shown in red.
- Saving a merge now generates a new .module file, leaving the original file intact.
- Added a new button to the Mod Merger to easily remove a merge from the system and revert to the original file.
- Fixed a crash with the Mod Manager when deleting multiple .module files at once.
- The Mod Merger now reacts to files being deleted/added manually from the system by the user.

## Version 2.1.8

- Fixed a rare bug where a wrong videocard was selected in Local.ini

## Version 2.1.7

- Added a new checkbox in the Settings-&amp;gt;Video tab to allow the user to easily set the usage of the DirectX 8 cursor (aka. -allowhwcursor). Setting this to zero can help with flickering cursor issues.
- Added a new tooltip to explain what this option does.
- Rearranged several UI elements in the main Mod Manager form into panels to allow for better scaling of the buttons etc.
- Refactored code a little bit so it's more human-friendly (by IgorTheLight)

## Version 2.1.5

- Added a safeguard to disable the ''Disable Fog'' checkbox when using the DoW Mod Manager not in Dawn of War: Soulstorm. Disable Fog only works properly in Dawn of War: Soulstorm.
