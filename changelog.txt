## Version 2.2.1

- Fixed a crash when there is no line 15 in spdx9_config.txt file in Drivers folder (thanks,  SergeantDiggs)
- WriteSettings() method in SettingManagerForm is more efficient now -allowhwcursor it uses StreamWriter instead of StringBuilder( + File.WriteAllLines())

- Fixed a bug where instead of a patch,  ModMownloaderForm would still download the mod itself
- Fixed a bug where you click on a non-existent item in RequiredMods Mods when you have no mods installed

- Renamed a few variables

## Version 2.1.9

- Fixed the tooltip for the ''No Fog'' disable checkbox, that didn't appear when it was supposed to.
- Added new warning label to the Mod Merger to warn users of potential causes of crashes when used inappropriately.
- Added support for mods, that are not installed but declared as a deactivated mod in a .module file to be displayed and handled in the mod merger.

- Refactored code a little bit so it's more human-friendly (by IgorTheLight)

## Version 2.1.5
